chewing a tablet daily is a very easy way to get fiber in your diet and control the amount of water that you are drinking and when you drink it
since i was a little girl my mother being military she always carried the jar of carmex around in her uniform pocket its a brand i know its a brand i trust from chapped lips to sore nose from a cold i love that little yellow jar

this is a great product to beat the gain weight vs no cold margaritas in the summer battle  good flavor and no calories i usually squeeze a lime into the pitcher and they taste great 
i did purchase this pressure washer about a month ago and just used it i am very happy with it i got a lot of bang for my buck i really like it
i had an appointment with a new dentist and she put carmex on my lips to keep them moistwell ever since that day i always buy carmexi love this product it keeps my lips softshinymoist and stays on long too i would definetely recommend this product

my favorite
by far my favorite product by lip balm i carry one in my purse one in my car kids each have one in their back packs and i have one in every room of the house i buy them as holiday gifts and stocking stuffers too 
the best bloody mary mix ever

ive been using carmex since my mom gave me a jar in high school and ive never gone back nothing else works even remotely as well i wont buy any lip balm if its not carmex thank you for making something so perfect please never change
this little jars contents are the item to go to when those stress or seasonal painful eruptions appear on my poor husbands lips saves the day everytime and it applied soon enough shortens the time of distress
i just picked this up for my wife and new mother as part of a mothers day gift we mixed it up before our dinner reservation last night at the house wow she was smiling for the rest of the night and i gotta say i really liked it too definitely recommend it for the ladies in your life probably great for a party at the house too
if youre going to take the time a pressure wash your driveway or your house this is not worth the time or effort the nozzle is so small and the actual dirt that comes off is the same amount from a normal hose
i needed some chapstick and told my husband to just get me something in a little tub he came home with carmex and i really like it it really moisturizes my lips and it lasts long so i dont have to reapply over and over
love to have once bud light with onces of clamato
hit at the party
i love this product and drink usually an oz bottle daily with nothing in it but the mix it is like snappy tom but i like it better the last time i ordered a case of it and it is almost gone already if you like a spicy tomato drink i highly recommend it
love love carmex products been a huge fan for years
mr mrs at its best if you havent tried it you havent lived walmart is the place to buy no matter what size your bank account is
i buy all carmex products love the flavors the most
i have been using this product since i was a child my mom swore by it and now as a mom of  i swear by it it is the only product that i can put on my kids or my lips before going to bed and wake up with completely healed lips during winter and cold and flu season best lip product out there
i didnt like the idea of clam and tomato juice but tried it anyway i was pleasantly surprised with its refreshing taste whether it is served over ice or as a part of a mixed drink it is excellent
zing zang is not new to me i have bought it at other stores for years and am glad to find at walmart for a competitive price just the right spices
this is my winter drychapped lip must have balm in the harsh chicago winters this is one of the only products that i know of which comforts my lips and keeps them soft
i love clamato i cant have alcohol due to health issues but i make a mean virgin drink add celery salt and a couple squeezes of lime juice stir with a celery stalk yum
ive used the carmex original in the lip balm jar for as long as i can remember ever since someone introduced it to me either in late elemtary or middle school so many many memories are associated with this simple little product that has grown up with me for  years i love how its never really changed except for some minor changes to the jar during those years until now these genius additions to the line that has only made it betterthank you carmex for being there being such an important part of my ever changing life
love it wouldnt mind drinking more
no matter how many products i try i always come back to carmex original for lasting moisture and protection
a good chorizo should color your cooking oil red when fried in a pan this chorizo does not don quijote is much better but more expensive and getting harder to find what a shame that we cannot buy a good chorizo here in the united states anymore
i dont buy much this product because i have to use my fingers and they are not always clean

this zing zang bloody mary mix is delicious very peppery  our new favorite mix 
i am in love with this lip balm the original pot version i love the way it makes my lips feel it makes them feel fresh smooth soft this is the only lip balm that doesnt irritate my lips other lip balms and glosses leave my lips numb and itchy this doesnt its like a miracle in a jar i never get cold sores but i use this like an everyday lip balm it is wonderful if you like wearing lipstick and sometimes have those annoying dry peeling lips put some of this on your lips while your getting ready then wipe it of and apply lipstick i like that its not oily greasy like the blistex in the jar carmex has the perfect texture the smell is like the original chapstick smell lol it kind of reminds me of the smell of a new baby dolls skin kind of powdery in a way but i like it its so cheap only cents at my walmart so worth buying you wont be disappointed you can also use it on dry hands as well its long lasting too
nice

love carmex doesnt feel waxy like other lip balms
easy container of lip balm that i can easily find in my purse that i know wont make a mess carmex lip balm works fantastically to keep my lips smooth
its a bit stickier than the brand name item i believe its worth the price to go with the walmart brand

i have used the carmex lip balm jar for many years  my mom who deceased now was the one who originally told me about it and she used it for many years
carmex is the brand i choose for my dry chapped lips best product you can buy
this is the only product that heals cold sores completely i had never had a cold sore before but a few weeks ago there it was i went to the pharmacy and bought an expensive medicine specifically for cold sores not only did it not work but actually made my lips itchy as i have been using carmex for years for my dry and chapped lips i thought okay ill give it a try on this cold sore like magic its gone this is a phenomenal product and i am super grateful to the people at carmex for consistently making high quality products from my lips i say thank you
used when younger all the time i love the classic jar and how well it soothes along with the soothing scent
highly recommend this premade moscow mule mix convenient to have at home and the recipe is a perfect balance to the rest of the ingredients reasonably priced too
every time i use it it really gets rid of my cold sores or heals my lips
i try to keep a jar of carmex in my winter coat pocket all of the time you never know when youre going to need it

tastes great    extremely hard to beat the price but it seems to be very hard to find  in stock  one of the managers told me that a large display of it just sat all summer  i personally dont understand it  ever since i found it  i go out of my way to buy it i personally like it more than some of the more expensive beers   
ive been using the pot carmex since the s i have loved it all these years back in the day anyone we were with would say can i use your carmex it was the only lip protection referred to someone always had carmex on them after all these years the pot carmex has not lost its fabulousness theres just something about applying carmex to your lips with your finger try it to see how smooth it glides on to all the right places for instant relief and a healthy little shine to your lips
this is a good price on this item this review was collected as part of a promotion
i have tried all of the carmex productsthis is my least favoritealthough it is very moisturizing i cant stand the smell or taste on my lipsif they would make it as awesome as the strawberry flavored stick it would be much better
tasted great twist off cap may easy to me if you put it down so it was knock down it would not spill out if you have cap on good a very good idea very good buy i understood some towards contributions go towards veterans
we us both use the original jar and tube my son use it all the time i buy it in bulk mu son use it a lot he is outside with sports so we have to keep a lot of it we dont see much of the other flavors just strawberry or cherry we stick to the originals jars and tubes
this original carmex has been around since i was a child i remember i used to get painful chapped lips from playing outside during the winter when i was little and my mom would always use this product to help healsoothe my lips it is a product that has stood the test of time and is still available today and for that i am thankful
im surprised how good this is for the price tastes more like sauvignon blanc to me
certain times of the year we all get chapped lips the first thing i reach for is carmax original it works its inexpensive and lasts a long time so crack the jar for instant relief of those seasonal dry lips simple
have tried otherskeep coming back to the best
my husband adds this to his beer instead of tomato juice

i have chronically chapped lips if i dont have carmex i have had them ever since i can remember other products do not work use carmex and keep your lips soft smooth and supple
this is good as drinking alone or mixing with your choice of other beverages
im a bartender this stuff is good try it you will not regret it
my lips are almost always chapped without carmex ive had dry and chapped lips for so long and ive tried everything blistex eos chapsticks lucas pawpaw and even medicated lip ointments i recently picked up a carmex over an instinctual urge and i dont think ive ever looked back since carmex does wonders for my lips theyre so smooth and soft now  even my boyfriend has commented on them the consistency is just right not too thin and not too thick ive found with lucas pawpaw its only good for chapped lips and blistex and eos only gives me a thin layer of lip balm i like to apply lip balm before i sleep because my room sits at a cool degrees celsius i find that because of the consistency carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when i wake up whilst pawpaw doesnt absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more i recommend this little tub of goodness to everyone and anyone who is looking for a great lip balm or lip remedy ive only needed to apply it  times daily and i have extremely dry and chapped lips from my medication and it works wonders for me i really love my little tub of carmex and its by far one of the best lip remedies ive picked up  at such an affordable price as well
love this product using it for years prefer it over the other chap stick kind more soothing than chap stick kind and doesnt remove the top lip layer great product
i only use clamoto for my shrimp cocteaus and drinks love the freshness
this drink is good im not a heavy drinker but a friend shared this drink with me and its light with a kick
these tortilla strips have a great flavor and pare well with salads and soups i enjoy the added flavor to any type of salad they are so good in a bowl of soup and remain crispy longer than you woukd expect
by far the best mix out there for classic margaritas to enjoy during the summer months
i wear lipstick all the time but i end up with dry lips carmex jar works very well with my lipstick and makes my lips very comfortable
amazing product sober for years and boy does this do it for me a pint a day keeps the doctor away
i have been buying this version of car next lip care since i was  i am now years old it is a regularly used part of my beauty regime keeps your lips soft smooth for hours using this product regularly also keeps those dry irritated winter lips away its amazing

i use this for my lips and rub on my cuticles to soften them it is even great on rough feet

i have to say i never thought of buying a mix like this but it is so tasty and delicious all you have to do is add your favorite whiskey and some robert porter over ice super easy manhattan and very smooth and tastes amazing highly recommended
ive used carmex lipbalm since elementary school and it is the only product that works for me
ive been using carmax for many years and i like it because it does what it says its going to do
taste just like i thought it would  would buy again
i bought this a month ago and it really works great
i have been using carmex for over years because i get cold sores every year and i have used nexcare and abreava and those are way expensive tooand i noticed that those take a week for your cold sore to hear and so i tried the carmex and its like gone in a day i actually got a cold sore yesterday  and its gone today i told my daughter about it a while back because she had a sore and she even used it i even recommend it to a lady at the store but i dont think she took my word for it
i love he convenience of this item i just wish they were already frozen
i really like this lip balm because it stays on a long time and really moisturized my lips
i like to add a shot of light rum and a shot of spiced rum its a little sweeter than i would prefer but not bad at all for a premixed drink it has been a hit at our pool parties
a well balanced and good tasting mix i would recommend this mix
i bought this size container for my dad very often he always had sore corners of his mouth and he loved the round container he wanted to always be ready for kisses from me and his nurses and it always healed the corners of his mouth wo a bad taste he used it daily
i bought three of these for the first time to make a new breakfast casserole one package was opened right after taking them out of the fridge and was the bottom of the casserole the second package was opened after everything was prepped and put into the casserole it was useless and had to be thrown away it was a ball of sticky gooey unshapable dough into the trash it went and my husband ran out to get another brand we had one pack left that i just used this morning straight out of the fridge and the rolls were just as good as the name brand my little ones even had seconds i think that the fact that they were still really cold when i opened the package and put them on the cookie sheet really helped
i use this item in my smoothies i like it better than having to use juice this with some yogurt and icevery good
very good mix i would give it a five star except i like mine not quite as hot still very good and would buy again needs to have a pinch less heat if you like your drink just a little on the spicy side your sure to like this
these are great i started taking for fiberdigestion but noticed they where clearing up congestion in my chest caused by allergies and the immune system building part of these vitamins where clearing up my allergieslove these vitamins for many reasons
makes very tasty frozen margaritas for a low price as good as some wellknow chain restaurant margaritas i highly recommend
ive been using this on my lips for over fifteen years and ive never had a cold sore since using it my lips are just as soft as well it does work
i have been using this product since i was a teenager long summer days filled with too much sun caused havoc on my lips but carmex saved them i still use it every night besides when im in the sun i have passed this secret down to my teenage daughters who refuse to use anything else
love this stuff use it all the time its beyond the best trusted brand
i started using carmex years ago and havent switched my lip balm since i love all forms of carmex but the jar is my favorite i love the consistency and how long it lasts especially my favorite in winter and fall because of how thick it is
this is my go to product for my family i have used this for years and will continue to do so
i have more than several jars of this at home and in my purse it orks better than anything else i have tried for dry lips love it
the great thing about the jar is that i can keep it in my car in the summer even if it melts it stays in the jar and i can still use it
my son has used this for over years has never been unhappy or given a thought to try anything new has never failed him myself i like the tube but the products are great please give it a try you wont have tolook anymore
i use this product all the time it work and the price is so cheap you get the best at the least
this light bodied ipa is dry hopped with cascade for a bold and bright hp aroma balanced by a refreshing and crisp ale great for a cookout out day at the beach love it
i used the jar for many years and recently switched to the tube both are amazing products and i tend to switch back and forth
clamato almost seems like they are embarrassed this great cocktail is seasoned with clams i wish there were more clam juice in it as they never mention that part of the name sake be proud you created such an awesome drink and it is indeed seasoned with clam juiceput more in please
addictively tasty
this is chemicals
i have used this product since the s in fact i cant remember ever being without it i love carmex
great taste and great price
this roscato is sweet very crisp and mildly sweet but it is delicious
the mix inside the container smells very similar to kool aid it is a good sugary drink mix when access to a blender or the time to make a homemade product is unavailable its decent for the price though my guest seemed to like it a word of caution before pouring anything into the bucket carefully inspect the bottom of the bucket and spout for damage on one of these my bucket was uknowlingly damaged and i lost a substantial amount as my margarita dripped out into the freezer  cheers
been using ty his product for years now and will continue for more years to come
i like carmex but this design is awkward if you put it in your pocket have to keep my finger clean when using not very functional
carmex original lip balm is the benchmark for all of the others on the market it is greaseless odorless and wonderful it works so fast and well i also use mine at night to keep the lips moist because of dry mouth it works well for us
i have been using this particular carmex product for several years the original lip balm jar has been a staple in my purse and in my kids christmas stockings every year for the past several years three of my kids are grown and they still want carmex for christmas i give them several jars so they have it all year this product keeps lips from chapping in the minnesota cold and also from the arkansas heat  i have lived several years in both states i love this product so much
this is the perfect size for my purse it makes my lips feel so soft
favorite mix if you enjoy making frozen drinks at home great flavor
been using this all of my life and i love it can bring it anywhere with me
its always my go to lip balm not only for myself but the whole family especially during cold winter months that is long lasting
i bought this product because i was in a squeeze to make drinks for a backyard bbq party i saw it on the the shelf only left and thought mm mules sound good for a nice spring day i had pretty low expectations given my experience with other pre mix products but let me tell you wow this product is delicious its the perfect balance of sweet and spicy ginger and reminds me of sipping out of fancy frozen glasses with friends at one my favorite outdoor cocktail bars next time ill just invite them to my backyard this mix has me excited to try some of the other flavors but i cant imagine ever passing up on the mule when i see it on the shelf thanks vincent whoever you are for making me a mule pro 
this stuff keeps my lips nice ands soft and protected
these were terrible it seems like they are just crammed into the packaging there is no way to roll them out into triangles it just comes out all smashed together and impossible to actually make crescent rolls out of them i ended up having to roll it all out and make my own too much work next time i will be spending the extra  or so and going with pillsbury heck id even pay  more to not deal with this garbage
the product advertise said pk i have no idea what that means but i assumed it was going to be pack  it turned out to be one bottle for   less expensive to buy at the store it does not make any sense
does great for my lips nothing else seems to work put it on over night and the next morning my lips where no long dry
very good used it to make cheese sticks
has a small kick to it but very delicious
the jar container is my other favorite because i can leave it in my car without worrying that it will melt and leak like the ones in the tubes sometimes do i love that i can have the product at hand no matter where i am or where im going
carmex is my go to for my lips every night before i go to bed it keeps my lips soft and beautiful all day long
we go through a bag of these the first day i bring them home they have the perfect amount of spicy i do wish there were more in the bag
its not often that you come across a wine this bad ive tasted cooking wines that were better unfortunately my wife bought four bottles of this stuff tried to return it but sams wouldnt accept it not that i blame them id pour it down the sink but it might damage the pipes sigh
love carmex but really wish it had spf protection
i use carmex all the time love it keeps my lips moist

i bought this a while ago i love it its very moisturizing
ive used carmex for years and am very happy with the product im just curious did the formula change it seems to smell different maybe my sniffer has changed please keep up the good product
i always have carmex in my purse i use it all the time specially during winter and those dry day lips
i have used carmex since i was a little girl i frequently get cold sores and this is the only thing that helps clear them up in a timely manner i have tried the more expensive treatments and none worked on me i dont leave leave home without it
i have been an avid user of carmex in the pot for the last years i was living in wisconsin when i started using this product in high school in the s i then moved to florida and they did not have carmex in the state of florida i was distraught and had to have my mother send me shipments of carmex so i could survive i have a pot of carmex in every room of my house my car my purses  everywhere i have tried all of the other lip products out there and the only one i find absolutely reliable everytime is carmex my lips have stayed so soft for so many years and i never have chapped lips carmex is the best thing since sliced bread
nothing else can compete to carmex best of the best like apple to mac
i absolutely love the carmex jar it is a must have for me at all times it is like a visa card for me i dont leave home without it
the best product on the market you cant go wrong using it 
my child could eat one every day

i bought this carmex jar because i had a cold and my lips and nose were chapped well not only did it help while i had my cold but i found the texture so nice for my lips i just continued to use it love it
love itworks wonders
i used this for my cold sores and it always kept them under control i did not know that you have a cold sore cream not good to say but i cant wait for my next cold sore to see how it does
the dough looked like it was crammed into the packaging i could not use it without combining the dough to roll out and cut wedges myself then they came out hard and very small it mustve been at the end of the line and what was left over this has happened more than once will not purchase again the savings is not worth it
i bought carmex original about two weeks ago and it works great it helped to heal my chapped lips in just a matter of hours i love it and would recommend it to anyone
i am a baby boomer and my lips have always known the great comfort of carmex
i purchase these all the time never had a problem with them

i was searching for coconut syrup at my walmart one day and i found this coco real in the mixed drinks section while i dont drink alcoholic drinks i do enjoy mocktails occasionally so i figured if it wouldnt work for pancakes then i could make pinacolada mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice i shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well then used it on my hot pancakes at home it was sooooo good i usually only use pure maple syrup on them but wanted some coconut syrup this really filled that need so well it was so delicious that i do believe i wouldnt even need to use butter on my pancakes when i use coco real as my syrup its not been easy to find locally for some reason not even at the walmart where i found it once i bought the last two bottles walmart had that day it would be very nice if walmartcom would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time i used one of those two bottles up pretty fast but since i cant find it anymore i am saving my remaining bottle for when i will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup torani also makes a good sugarfree coconut syrup that i would like for walmartcom to keep in stock regularly as well as their sugarfree watermelon syrup in the hot summertime torani sugarfree watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks and it goes well with mexican food which i really enjoy its the next best thing to liquefying cubes of real watermelon in my blender and chilled
beginning in about rd grade approx  every fall i would be cursed w a huge reddishpurple ring around my mouth from having severely dry lips literally using my upper lower lips as my chap aid spending the afternoon w my grandmother she stopped at a local pharmacy to buy me a tube of chapstick the pharmacist helping her suggested that we try a new aid handed her a little yellow tin tub of carmex suggested we try it i used it nonstop for the next few days and amazed my whole family w how well fast carmex did the job i have used nothing else ever since my lips belong solely to carmex many thanks carmex

ive used the balm in a jar for years under and over lipstick and i love the fact that it stays put
refreshing and not too sweet

my wife bought this cream a few month ago and to be honest i was under the impression that it would be like all the other balms oh boy was i wrong this little wonder balm is the cure to my chapped limps and the cure to my cold sores yes cold sores in fact it beats all other cold sore medication out there when i use regularly meaning i dont lose my jar like i often do it prevents chapped lips and cold sores from reappearing plus i love the tingling sensation you get after you apply it i recommend it to all my friends now that i found this product my pharmacy does not carry it anymore now i have to find another place to get it with the help of the website i think i found a solution thank you carmex

bought this product a while ago and its the best choice ive ever made
i have been using carmex for over yrs and the original jar is still my choice easy to use just the right amount for total lip protection best product on the market for overall lip health
i buy atleast two little jars of carmen a month for my roommate and i we are addicted
i love the jar becuase i love touching my lips and i love the idea of being able to control the amount of carmax you want on your finger the jar is also most ideal when wanting to share with friends and family as you dont have to worry about their lips touching your stick each person gets their own individual amount the jar is the best also if you happen to get a cold sore you dont have to scrape of the top layer on the stick wasting product as to prevent the cold sore from coming back and spreading using a jar keeps your lips from wasting product
i love keeping a jar at home for use before bed or if i need it during the night i also keep a jar for each of my kids especially during the winter when lips get chapped the most they lick their lips and cause that ring around the mouth that this product helps get rid of fast they keep theirs by their beds in case they need it during night also i like the how smooth it is and the scent is also very pleasant my kids like the smell of it especially when having a cold it seems to help them clear their nose better
this carmex lip balm jar is amazing its very useful
excellent
just bought a new little jar great and special to use it
i love to buy clamato at walmart the price is very good and the product is good i buy it for my micheladas
i love the way this product helps i have a problem with my lips getting cold sores iin the fall and winter monthswith carmex i dont have that problem anymore so thank you carmex for your amazing product
as the title says its simply the best it will heal the cracked lips i get in the winter as well as moisturize i will never use anything else
my go to lip balm long lasting and always sooths
this mix is top notch the bees knees whether i am relaxing at the end of my day or entertaining guests i must always have this mule mix on deck would recommend to anybody
this is an excellent red wine not to dry and not real sweet more of a red blend great go with anything anytime in the right price point as other known brands on the market
i am hands down a vodkadrinker and love a good moscow mule especially in one of those icy cold copper mugs my only complaint is that when i order them at bars they are often way too sweet this product tastes like fresh ginger and lime and the sugar is balanced perfectly great crowd pleaser when entertaining people will think you made it from scratch
i was so happy to have located mr mrs t mai tai mix at wallmart online it is nearly impossible to find it in nj grocery or liquor stores usually i am not a fan of any bar drink mixes particularly now sugary ones but this one is a fabulous concoction not too sweet the flavors are well balanced between sweet sour with a touch of bitter almonds just excellent to drink as is or it is very simple to prepare an exotic cocktail by addiing baccardi rum garnish with maraschino cherry and a sliver of pineapple on a skewer i have been impressing our guests with it the entire summer  had to even give up one bottle to my neigbors we are hooked wallmart send the product promptly for a very reasonable sh charge it arrived in good condition product is shelf stable ill be ordering it again next season or maybe earlier if we want to have a nice summer cocktail in the winter months
i lke drink it  a glass white lime and salt taste so good and no more hangover
carmex lip balm jar is a must have for me cant sleep without it i always keep a jar in my purse car and bedside love it

i have been using carmex for approximately fourtyyears carmex is the only lip balm that protects my lips from chapping i personally know that if i did not have my carmex my lips would not be as smooth and vibrate as they are thank you
ive been using this product for years i bought it years ago during the winter when my lips were very chapped it worked like a miracle and ive never looked back i buy it during all seasons of the year
i use carmex when i have a split on my lip from the cold or dry air and i love this stuff it heals it as soon as i use it
last fall i had the most wind chapped and dry lips i bought carmex original and my problem was gone no bad taste and works invisibly
when it comes to making perfect margaritas sauza signature blue my go to tequila anchor hocking oz goblet frozen with a margarita salt rim it doesnt get any better

living in the desert it is a struggle to keep my lips from drying out and cracking when daily summer temps are over degrees daily protecting my lips is important the only thing that works is carmex i prefer the original jar
low pricegreat taste
this is also good in red beers lots of spices and tang
it was a great buy
im always putting lip balm on this is great for the purse
these chicken wyngz were gross way too much breading and the taste of buffalo sauce was barely noticeable at the price walmart sells these at i cant recommend them on any level
we added rum and this made a great refreshing dink to have my the pool
i dont know why i like the jar better than the tube or stick but i have tried them all i will always use the jar everyone says i have an addiction to carmex carry it in my car purse next to my bed in my desk at work yes it works i lip my lips a lot and it stays on
best item i have ever purchased hands down so delicious words cant do it justice my favorite part is the clams and also the tomato how is it possible to unite two vastly different flavor a in such a harmonizing blend i dont know but the result is beautiful and so delicious i will definitely purchase again actually i am on the way right now walmart that is to buy clamato
i have been using carmex for a long time and it is my favorite lip balm i use it in all its forms but i especially like the original jar
i have been using carmex for the last years i have a tube on each of my keyrings if someone needs to borrow my keys i aways take the carmen off because i cant live without it
i havebeen using this for over yrs and love it
i remember back when i was a small child my father would always be on my case about putting carmex on my lips because they were always so sore and chapped of course a year old wouldnt care until the winter came my lips were so chapped and i started getting cold sores all over my mouth so i finally listened to my dad about putting carmex on my lips ever since i started  i never stopped carmex is such an amazing product  my lips have never again got crusty and i havent had a sore since elementary school
great way to increase fiber intake
this is the most amazing bloody mary mix not only is it great for bloody marys but great for red beer too
these english muffins are very good and they are half the price of others
not as tasty as fresh made but still tasty and very convenient to have in your pantry especially with the holidays coming up
i purchased an electric model just to avoid another gas engine this model works good cleaning our patio aggregate steps walk driveway its light weight easy to store priced accordingly
very quick and easy to prepare and yet so yummy
i know people claim that carmex is addictive and i know that you claim its not either way i love it i slather virtually half of my face with it prior to bed each night i dont wear it during the day because i dont like feeling the least bit greasy anyway i just wanted to tell you that i love carmex i once forgot to bring my carmex with me on business trip and i was stuck buying an overpriced chapstick in a hotel lobby and boy is that stuff junk it felt like i was spreading old cheese on my lips this is an any day must have
i have loved carmex in a jar since i was a little kid i am biased as im from wisconsin and carmex is a wisconsin company but that just means they understand how chapped lips and skin can get this is the only thing i have ever used that actually works and it works overnight most times i have dry skin on my lips i love it
this is a phenomenal wine and my new favorite red
i keep carmex lip balm jar on hand all the time it works great on fever blisters and chapped lips
i have grown up using this product its a household must have i always have it on hand wether it be on my nightstand or in my bathroom cabinet i love it

my first choice in mixers
my sister and i really enjoyed the flavor of this mix it was truly like biting into a mango
i have been a fan of carmex for years its thick and last long especially in the winter months
refreshing nice grapefruit flavor not for people that dislike seltzer water its good out of the can or poured over ice
i love mango everything i dont like pure sugar this is so very thick sweet even if i try it in a frozen margarita i am sticking with the citrus one
i like the product because you can drink it straight for a refreshing drink over ice  since told about the product i have made several purchases and recommend this for a different drink of choice
i have used carmex for as long as i can remember the fragrance is what drew me in i thought well at least my lips will smell good but i was pleasantly surprised at how moist and smooth it kept my lips i have a jar of carmex at my desk one in my purse and i never run out
always a big hit at pool parties also good to keep in the freezer for a quick and easy drink delicious
i always keep carmex on hand it is always nice to have during harsh summer sun or cold ia winters gives your lips healing security toss it in your purse or keep it in your pocket always there to heal nothing compares for those dreaded cold sores that peak during the flu season
thanks to my pawpaw using this he got me hooked perfect for hunting never have to worry about chapped lips rather im shoveling snow sleeping or hunting incredibly soft lips

i went to a specialty makeup party and the lady said carmex was the best lip product on the market i already used it and had to totally agree with her
carmex is our preferred lip care product for irritated and dry lips we love how it warms and immediately gives relief when we need it i chose the original container but we use any carmex

this chalk is nice and sturdy even for a rowdy year old
is this the greatest wine in the world of course not it is an eminently drinkable wineas a matter of fact it is my preferred and go to table wine wine is a personal thing but for me it is my pick in the under category it is well balanced subtle and very easy to sip dry without being overpowering it is not a big bad cabernet but it is not that in a good way goes great by itself or paired with cheese or a dish sauced with something heavier like a bernaise i always have a bottle on my shelf
ive tried several if not all bloody mary mixes as this is my drink of choice zing zang is the absolute perfect blend of flavor and spices absolutely my favorite must try
ive used this product for so many years from chapped lips to irritated peeling nostrils from blowing my nose lol this particular one is my absolute favorite i always keep it on hand and in my nightstand is a must
very good value for cost
since i started using this product cant hardly drink a margarita made with high calorie mixers fortunately more folks in my walmart area are also starting to use and now our local walmart rarely doesnt have it
i buy carmex every month and i love having moisturized lips
i have used this for years i have tried other products and they do not work for me
i keep this on hand i probably have about of them i use it as soon as i feel im getting a cold sore it works fast for me
if im going to buy a sangria this is not the one id choose the flavor was not as fruity as others ive had and was not pleasant for my palate
great price on this very good product
this product as well as many others would be more appealing to me and others if the hfcs was replaced with cane sugar you have a good product and there are ways to make it better an increase in price would not deter me in the least look at the growth of the organic industry need i say more
this stuff is the best for winter dry and chapped lips also good for sunburned lips in the summer i scrape the bottom of the jar every time 
absoloutley amazing it works so well for my awfully sore lips and gets to work in an instant
i have used carmex for years and years it is important to carry on in your purse i have needed and it does not take up a lot of space either you will not be disppointed in this choice
my mother was actually buried  with a jar of carmex in one hand and a kleenex in another she was never seen without either i would purchase the carmex jar by the box for her she would have a jar always within a few feet if not closer to her
if i could give these crescent rolls less that a full star rating i would i would even give it a negative star of course whenever you buy any pre made dough in a pop can you expect a pop well nothing happenedat first i had to bang it on the counter to open and when it did it was more of a bang than a pop and dough shot out all over the place the dough that was salvageable in no way resembled a crescent i had to form it into triangles by myself of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible the taste of the finished rolls did however taste the same as name brand rolls but the measly few cents saved to purchase the great value brand was not worth the extra work and mess to purchase from now on i know to go with a more reputable brand
i love carmen lip balm in a jar i love the way my lips feel every time i use it i buy carmex at least every other month i use it daily
ive been using carmex for the past two years this product keeps your lips moist and smooth i got to say that before i started using carmex i normally used to get cold sores and other cold sore products did not help at all i tried all of them like abreva and spent so much money on products like that and my cold sores took a long time to heal or got worse my friend told me about carmex so i tried carmex when i had the sores and i it was amazing how my sore was diminishing and was gone so quickly i always keep carmex in my bag dresser in my car definitely would recommend this product to friends and family
i buy this item every year when the winter months start its a classic that reminds me of my childhood keep up the great work carmex

sweet and tasty
i use this on my lips all year long for soft kissable lips i also use it on my upper lip and outside my nose when i have a cold i put it on at night and when i wake up in the morning you would never know my skin was sore or chapped
wonderful crescent rolls excellent taste these are my new favorite rolls

great product
i have used this for years it is my go to product when my lips are super chapped
not fruity very satisfying my go to chardonnay excellent product  would expect to pay  bottle for this quality
i bought this days a ago and im a first time user of this brand and not sure if i use again as my lips are on fire every time i apply is this a normal reaction or am i just using the wrongs thing because thousands of people across the world rave about how amazing it is feedback would be great to hear
taste great but never enough in stock at the stores
i use carmex year round for lip care its the best
carmex is my favorite lip balm ever it always helps my chapped lips i love it
these rolls were much smaller than pillsburys and much harder to get out of the can they ripped and shredded making them just about worthless i will not purchase again
i have used this product for many years and would never switch to anythings else it is the best ever
delio only problem they cooked unevenly
helps internal operations
i have been using carmex lip balm for years and it is the only product that takes care of my chapped lips or sunburned lips also is great for chapping around nose and lips from colds
i have used it to make my chapped lips softer used it over my lipstick so so many uses keep it around as a regular a necessity in our house
the dough was not was to unroll or separate
based on positive reviews i served all of the fancy pants varieties at a recent party my guests and i loved them since i am not a wine expert i will provide some details on this variety from the fancy pants website is like sunshine in the glass its brisk and bright with inviting citrus melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate vibrant acidity and a crisp clean finish make this wine a versatile partner for a wide range of foodsespecially succulent seafood mediterraneanstyle grilled vegetables and salads served well chilled our sauvignon blanc is fun and friendlythe perfect pour for sunny afternoons and picnics

i love the size and the price on this cooler however the lower quality than brand name coolers is evident in the finish on this cooler after about weeks of use the rope handle pulled loose while lifting and the cooler fell to the ground but survived the fall trademark innovations please send me new plastic handles
its been a year since i started using this product and im glad to say it changed my lips for the better ive recommended this product to many friends who have dry chapped lips like myself and they share the same feelings definitely will be repurchasing this for a very long time
i brought it a while ago and it help with my chapped lips
battle ground walmart is to high priced to surrounding stores
i love the original but i should explore other flavors
i have used carmex original lip balm in the little round jar for many years and it has always come through for me there are not many products out there that i have found that work consistently and do exactly what they claim to do but this one does at the first hint of a cold sore i grab the carmex as quickly as i can and apply it it stops the cold sore from progressing and heals what is trying to pop out if i cant find my little jar i panic and hurry to the store to buy another one no one wants to go around with an ugly cold sore ive always thought it amazing that a product that works so well would be so affordable
made our party special everyone was pleased with our choice of drinks
my husband has been using this product for years he works outside in all the elements from blistering heat to freezing cold swears by your product
super wine with fruity taste as a regular wine drinker this is our routine wine of choice priced right with good taste
i buy the carmex in the tub becuase it is how my mother always had it we wood open it up and smell that wonderful carmex scent glides on smooth but its scent is what i love the best no other brand smells like it
if you are trying to save calories and still have a tasty margarita this mix is great use a few drops of essential lime oil to give a more natural taste though
tastes like juice that makes you unwind perfect for that end of the day glass i only wish it were easier to find my local store is often out of stock
they fall apart when you get them out of package they are different sizes too they look like someone just threw them in the package when you open it unlike pillsbury crescent rolls

fruity full body cheap go well with asian foods if you are looking to buy a red for wedding this is the one i got so many compliments from my anniversary this year on this red if you want the cheaper wine sure you can go with veo or menage a trois though carnivor is still a great wine
ive tried lip balm in sticks and tubes but the carmex jar is still the best container maybe its just habit but the unscrew and finger dip applies the protection and revitalization of carmex more satisfactorily than any other method
my kids loved these

this is my favorite brand and sizei drink it instead of v for breakfast along with an occasional true bloody mary when i am entertaining friends my only complaint is the delivery packaging of a pack of  the box was delivered upside down and was ripped  the contents thankfully were not damaged it would help if the outer box was labeled this side up

i was in the hospital and my lips were cracked and dry carmex saved me from a time period that would have been painful
this is amazing i was shocked by how smooth and tasty it was usually i do not buy cocktail mixes but a friend recommended this one to me and i am so glad she did i love it it will defiantly be a staple in my home and parties
i have always loved the pot carmex besides loving the product when i forget to take it out of my pocket it washes and drys perfectly
bought this to prevent me from getting chapped lips needless to say it did the job
sams club is percent pleasing with its all of its sales products everything from electrical electronic groceries furniture building products recreational and mechanical etc my black max pressure washer gets five stars and the sales price was the best i recommended that my youngest son purchase one and he loves it too thanks sams club
i use it not just in winter months but under my lipstick
i usually always buy carmex when it comes to lip balm and the original jar is one of my goto carmex products i do love the cherry and tubes but the jar is very convenient to have around and less likely to lose it lasts forever as well i apply it every day multiple times a day and it still looks like i havent made a dent in the product after a month it keeps my lips moisturizer for hours and doesnt leave a greasy residue or doesnt feel sticky like other lip balms do highly recommend this to keep at your desk for work or in your purse
my absolute favorite go to anytime of year great for chapped lips especially
took tries to get the right order the product itself is very good

i have been using this product for over years it works on everything even chaffed skin
i always have it on hand to keep my lips healthy and smooth
this mix is overly sweet and probably could lose the high fructose corn syrup it also has a soapy taste often associated with coconut oil i will be dumping it out

love this product i have been using for it for years and it has never let me down

i absolutely love carmex and am totally addicted to it i love it so much and use it so much that i actually kept all of my jars for a whole year to see how many i use it ended up being jars in a year i always have in my pocket in my car in my purse l and by my bed at all times
this is my favorite lip balm it is so moisturizing
im a woman who doesnt like to wait for her husband to help her do something i can operate this by myself i was surprised at how nicely it cleaned our composite decking our year oldcement steps had green moss and black stains and i was able to clean they also i used scotts outdoor soap and can easily attach different nozzles and attachments i hated our our gas power washer and we had much trouble with it i hope this one lasts as it is a good value
the big thing in high school was to always have car ex in the jar i graduated in and have been using ever since i may not be able to find my keys money etc in my purse but i can always find my carmex leaves my lips feeling soft and smooth and cures dry chapped lips in no time i cant live without it love this product
excellent thick and rich with just the right amount of kick i always ordered this on the jets when i travelled
this is a light slightly bubbly tasting wine not too sweet not too bitter and dry
the product last for months and you dont have to keep reapplying the medication keeps you lips soft
my family and i have used this for years and will always use it it works wonderful
great during winter and cold weather easy to apply
i was a big balsamic fan but this is now my go to for salad dressing
this product is so simple and easy to use  ive tried different manhatan mixes before and this one is by far my favorite it meshes very well w any burbon and the flavors dont overpower and try to mask the burbon like other products  its an essential to my mini bar at home amazing product
after many years of using various other lip balms discovering carmex was a game changer i will never use another lip balm
ive been using this product for as long as i can remembermy mom used to buy it for me and now i buy it for my kids the best thing for those chapped winter lips
i could no longer fine my usual brand even on the company website so i started looking for a new mai tai mixer look it up these are complicated to make from scratch i kept seeing this brand so i decided to order it and was very pleasantly surprized this mix is a little more pineapple than the last but i like that
i never thought mixes could be so good i have been a cocktail enthusiast for sometime now but can never find the time to go out this mix makes fantastic drinks in the comfort of my own home without emptying my wallet i have all of my friends hooked on it now as well it makes a perfect gift for fellow cocktail lovers anytime of the year i could not give this product enough stars
been looking for strongbow in the us for years
it was a good choice for me it was delivered on time i order azo i ordered two but only got one because the person who delivered it dropped it over the gate and my dogs got a hold of it there is a note on the outside of gate asking the person who delivers packages to put it on the ledge and for some reason the person didnt read the note
no after taste love this wine
i bought this awhile ago and i love it it is great
i am in love with carmex nothing works faster healing my chapped lips
i love how well this product works after using it for one day i wake up the next morning with no chapped lips i love this product it works so well
i always go back to carmex original lip balm jar the little jar fits perfectly in my purse and has never failed to soothe dry chapped lips
i am prone to severe chapped lips if i dont use chap stick every day my lips dry out to the point that they crack and bleed unlike most chap sticks which work for a few hours then need to be reapplied every or hours the carmex jar is long lasting i can put it on twice a day before work and before bed and my lips are fine sometimes i can even get do fine using it just once a day if the weather isnt harsh if its really cold or dry i still only need to use chap stick midday once when i use the carmex morning and night which is a vast improvement i love it added bonus the jar is my favorite color
love carmex my favorite and must have for everyone
bought assembled and used it to clean concrete with mold mildew and moss on it worked great
i use this for cooking just enough kick
picked some up on a trip to the beach as they are portable non breakable and priced right i didnt know what to expect honestly my expectations were not too high being boxed wine and all i was pleasantly surprised it is very drinkable delicious when i got home i returned to target to get the large wine cube box for at home enjoyment
i was using other products but a friend told me to try using carmex i decided to give it a try and now it is the only product i will buy it works better than any of the other products i have used in the past
i love carmex original lip balm in a jar i use it all the time it works not only on your lips but also for problem skin areas like ears hairline chin elbows etc i love the consistency and the flavor it lasts a long time and helps to heal any kind of skin just wish it came in a larger size than  oz i would love a or oz size 
ive used this many times over the years and have never been disappointed in it
i really really enjoyed this the taste was perfect and not too sweet cant wait to use it to entertain this summer yum

the carmex lip balm in a jar works so well i just throw it in my purse and get on with my life wherever i go
my hubby loves this and wants to always have it on hand when my girlfriends come overyeah
my lips were chapped this soothed and help heal them
i grew up loving shasta but i can never find their best flavors it comes with lemonlime orange grape and fruit punch my favorite is the punch and in my opinion the lemonlime is better than most lemonlime sodas the grape and orange are just okay it is nothing special but it is a pretty good value also nice to have a variety of sodas handy on hot summer days especially when having guests over
it is a very good drink it has a marvolous taste and a very good value including that it is non alcoholic i recomend it to any one who wants to ahve a drink without the hangover and the risk of getting drunk
the best collins mix you will ever find
this is one of my favorites feels the best on my lips only downside is i hate when i have nothing to wipe my finger off with lol but my lips always look and feel better just after a couple days
not only does carmex cure my chapped lips in no time it also cures my sore and burned nose during cold and flu time if you havent tried it on your tissue burned nose i urge to to try it it works so good plus the minty eucalyptus type smell opens your nostrils birds one stone
this has been my go to product for years softens and protect from all wisconsin weather
i tiered many products  but nothings works for my chapped lips like carmex i keep on in my car briefcase and desk at home
great refreshing taste not a weak beer safe ingredients that are nongmo
carmex original pot is the only product that instantly relieved the pain of burning sore lips it also heals them back to health and the little pit wont leak in a hot car always one in the car and one in my travel bag
this is a wonderful change of pace if you like margaritas you will not be sorry youve given it a try
nothing makes my lips feel more protected and silky loved it then love it now
i use this all year around and it works all year around for every every season
i have used this product for over years and i still use it several times each day i couldnt go without it
from the st time i used carmax i fell in love with it it restored the beauty of my lips i no longer use lip gloss i never leave home without it
i always have a little jar of carmex with me where ever i go it is a classic staple that keeps my dry chapped lips moisturized and soft
i keep this in my purse at all times i use it year round i believe it helps keep my lips moist and the areas directly around my lips from getting wrinkles
ive been using this since the salways loved itnever gonna change
i have used carmex for years i have tried other products but nothing compares to carmex in keeping my lips protected from the heat of summer or the cold of winter thank you for making such an amazing product
first used the original at  feet gunnison colorado in 
good for pina coladas no complains
and dont let the price sway your selection we have served these wines from super bowl gatherings to most recently our thanksgiving celebration everyone enjoyed the wines and when we asked what they thought they cost they couldnt believe the value love the belle made for you wines
although i dont feel its necessary to describe how angels came down from heaven to squeeze tiny droplets of nirvana into a bottle to be sold across the country in retailers under this brand and recipe i feel i will be expressing this to everyone i meet until the bitter end of my life this mix this powerful concoction of pure ecstasy  is unbelievably awesome and will likely turn me into a raging alcoholic passed out in a gutter occasionally coming to the surface to scream i need more as monkeys and degenerate courtesans frolic in my bodily fluids streaming from both ends its that freaking good folks buy it buy cases of it snort it drink it shoot it whatever you do  just try it once you do youll be on here leaving another depraved review hopefully three times more twisted than mine god speed god speed
ive been drinking for over years love this stuff and you can drink by itself
it was very fresh and cheaper than anywhere in the area
first time trying these really good
they barely have a hint of buffalo flavor if you like your wings to taste of nothing but pepper than these are for you they have plenty of flavor to them just not what your expecting for buffalo flavor now the wings themselves are not bad they are decently meaty maybe a little to heavy on the breading but not to bad though the sizes of the wings vary greatly but not really a big deal id by them again if they change the flavoring but id say just stick to the plain and get your own sauce
this is a great product to have at home
i have used this product since i was in my teens it is been my favorite product and i will continue to use it
i used to use eos and i found out that i was allergic to it so i stuck with carmex carmex is the best lip balm in the world
i carry the carmex jar with me at all times as well as always having it on my desk at work i dont know why the jar that i love it so much so this is the one of only few kinds i buys from carmex and love it
used this postfacial surgery helped my dry cracked and painful lips only thing that actually helped me feel healthy again cant wait to use the other products
equilivant to pillsbury good product
decent table wine for the price bend that is on the sweeter side of the spectrum
my daughter and use this product everyday and we just absolutely love it
i am constantly making sure i have my little jar available in my purse i also pick up extras just in case somebody needs some this is the greatest balm for your lips
ive used this product in the pot for over yrs til it came out in a tube ive used the tube ever since ive tried everything on the market and nothing works like it does i still dont like the smell or flavor but im hooked ive tried the cherry and didnt care for it at all have you every thought about vanilla or mint in the tube because i find the vanilla in the stick to be the right smellflavor but i dont like the texture and it doesnt last like the original on your lips thank you i have tube all over my house and everywhere i go if not i have to stop and buy some
try it you will love it
a wonderful dry wine and the taste is just divine
my kids love these quick on the go breakfast for busy moms no syrup required
i am by far the first to go the natural route for anything however carmex is the best lip balm that i have ever found there just isnt anything quite like it healing penetrating numbing if i could be addicted to a lip balm this would be it
i really like this lip balm as i have a bad habit to always lick my lips i always put a thick layer on my lips before i head to bed it keep it very moist 
ive been using this since i was a kid nothing beats this for severely dried and cracked lips
if you never tried it its time for you to do it keep your lips moist and healthy
this is my favorite i love the jar lip therapy the best
great taste makes a good mixer
i bought two months ago i absolutely love them they last long and keep your lips smooth
bought this on a whim last minute for a dinner party and was very pleasantly surprised  tried it with both bourbon bulleit and rye rittenhouse and both came out great it has a nice citrusyness that brings all the flavors together quite nicely and it wasnt too sweet or syrupy or artificial tasting at all loved this product and will definitely be making it a staple in my home barcant wait to sample the other products in their line as well
we dont like this brand as good as the daileys brand but it will do we cant find the daileys anywhere so we settled for this we dont use it for alcohol we use it to make smoothies with
works very well love how my lips feel  great product
i have been using carmex forever when you see the little jar you know that relief is just seconds away this original product reminds me of going to the drugstore and seeing the little jar right by the cash register great memories of a great product
it took me orders to get the right product the collins mix was to sweet for my taste i tried diluting the mix to cut down on the sweetness but to no avail i found a product called polar tom collins mix which was almost perfect and can be purchased online for a much lower price
the chicken did not have much flavor and tasted cheap
i have little jars everywhere on my bedside standin my pursecar and my bag when i travel it applies easily and works for me
i can carry this in my pocket all the time works great
these are very tasty rolls i was a little surprise as how good considering the price
this wine taste really good i love the soft flavor i will buy this again
my son and grandson love these wings
somehow i found this balm in romania in a little store i decided to buy it the jar was so interesting the price was good too but i must admit my expectations werent very high i have a lot of lip balms and none of them really works and then such a big surprise the menthol the camphor these arent very usual for lip balms but they did a good job with my lips together with the other ingredients it became my favourite balm in the world i would be sooo happy to try the other products but unfortunately its impossible to buy these from here and to bring them from the usa its too expensive
ive used this for years and there is nothing like it on the market a must have in the winter
very good
i have bought this lip balm few days ago never heard of it before best product ever fell in love with it immediately
i purchase this every time i go to sams then is started to disappear this last time we went there was a mini case of sixbought them all scared that something this good might not reappear please reassure us that you will continue to carry it
i only buy this chapstick it feels good and keeps my lips moisturized
i have stocked up on this brand and bottle since years ago and have had tons still left to use i have one in my car purse and bedroom this is my go to lip product and cant leave the house without it ever
i used to use the cherry chapstick from the brand chapstick and their cakebatter flavored one as well but i stuggled with them in combination one would work or the other would but neither were helping me so eventually i searched for something new to help relive my dry almost papery lips i tried the original carmex and i was in love after the first two days i put it on as soon as i got it and slept with it overnight when i woke up it was like my lips were never damaged i love carmex and thank you so much
i used this product since i was young great stuff
i also got this during sams spring sale having messed with my fathers year old electric pressure washer i didnt have high hopes i was looking for something inexpensive that would clean my driveway grill and fence every so often yes gas models are more powerful but theyre more expensive and you need to maintain them first off  the build quality seems rugged metal couplings for hoses vs plastic for my dads old one how well it does concrete was cleaned the big circle washer does an ok job but the turbo washer really gets it done see photo the big circle washer would be good for maintaining not for a deep clean also had no issues cleaning my grill from years of grease overall with a year warranty im pretty happy with this
obsessed with this new drinkhowever it has been sold out at every target i have been to lately 
i did not have the same experience as the other reviewer what we got was just as advertised  chunks of white meat in breading my kids love these
i was shyed away at first from clamato strange enough i love bloody marys and all i eat is seafood so one would think clams and tomato juice wouldnt be a problem well i made my own bloody caesar with clamato at home a touch of cracked pepper hot sauce old bay seasoning and it was fantastic
i love this product so much because it keeps my lips soft and hydrated i have tried everything and this is my goal standard
carmex is the standard others attempt to achieve there is no better product for lips and cuticles so thankful for the new large container
the product is hard to find in my area therefore its great to get it online and shipped to me in two days with shopping pass membership
i love carmex however it is really difficult to find here in brazil
i just brought this carmex lip balm because my lips are very chapped and dry and i love it and its cute little container that i can store pretty much anywherei have never used a lip balm as much as this one and have only had it for days and i have already seen a improvement in my lip moisture and no other lip balm has shown that much improvement for me so soonand i have stocked up and brought like more to last me for a month i hopebut i might need morebut i like how it feels minty or refreshing on my lipsso i plan on sticking with your product because its perfect for me 
cheaper to buy on amazoncom i believe and i tried to cancel this order but it got here so fast my head was spinning
very handy to keep in bag when you need lip balm for dry lips thanks
great product fresh ingredients made a great mule my friends dont have to know it was a mix 
my favorite lip balm i use it all the time to ensure that my lips are just right
i grew up with this in my house my mom always had some that she used all the time in the winter also whenever she got a cold sore i never had any colds sores so i do not know if it really helps with that but i do know that it is great for those drycracked windburned lips that those of us living up north get every winter
what has to happened clamato over the past few months i have noticed a distinct difference in the taste of clamato original there seems to be less clam juice taste and more tomato and sweet taste is it just me or has anyone else noticed i want more clam
i have been drinking it for quite awhile like it better than hot v
this product is awesome my nose and lips were raw from a nasty cold carmex soothed and healed this severe chapped skin in seconds i was looking for a product with the healing product of lanolin and was pleased to find it is the second main ingredient thanks to carmex im back to feeling great

i bought the original carmex two weeks ago in that short time of daily use my lips feel so soft and no hint of dryness i love the product
my husband is an avid hunter with sensitive skin out in the elements at all hours his lips use to dry out and crack making my kisses hurtful thanks to carmex his lips are protected and now softer and more kissable than ever thanks carmex
i have been using fiber choice tabs for several years and feel they help keep bowel movements normal they are a little pricey at cents per tablet but are much easier to take than mixing powders with water  so convenience is worth something
one day after years of battling chapped lips someone suggested i try carmen so i did low and behold it worked better then any other chap items i had used whether it was chapstick or vaseline or any lip balms etc i still put a small coat on my lips even if they are not chapped just because it prevents chapping and feels good
garmex works greative tried many other brandsgeneric and name brand but carmex ot does them all
i ordered of these buckets and when i opened them up a couple of the buckets had holes in the bottom the margarita was good
i love the jars of carmex they work great and are long lasting i dont think ive ever finished a while jar i end up losing them first
i have used carmex for years it is the only lip moisturizertherapy that works for my lips i have tried many others including all the name brand type but carmex is the only one that works every time i use it winter and summer
worked great kids loved them
i have tried everything on the market and this is the best
these chalk are cheap but i guess you get what you pay for because they dont write well 
it is fine but it lacked the weight control feature that i was hoping for my fault i guess but its fine otherwise
i have always used these products over my many years and my parents have always used these as well i just love everything about them every product and love the cherry
i have been using carmex original lip balm in the jar since i was a child i remember my mom getting out the little tub of carmex putting on my lips before i went out the door winter spring summer or fall when i was a teen there would always be a little jar in my christmas stocking along with a tube now that i wanted to wear lip gloss i never went to lip gloss just my carmex as my own daughters came i would put a little carmex on their lips before they left the house toothey got a little tub in their christmas stockings now i have granddaughters who get a little carmex on their lips before they go out from me their moms they also get a little jar flavored tubes in their christmas stockings all these years later at yrs old its still my go to lip quencher season after season a christmas stocking favorite
this balm is the bomb im on med that leave my lips chapped alot so i use it at nite to prevent cracking  it will heal them overnite also
very small amount for the price wont make this mistake again
one of my goto chardonnay wines for everyday enjoyment sams has this well priced
i had bought this a couple months ago and let me tell youit works wonders i absolutely am in love with this product my lips love it
used to use this in my younger daysbut i lost them alot cause the lump im my pocket had to go and them i forgot them the tubes rule
ive been a fan for years my husband loves the product too
had a gas pressure washer worked well for a couple of years with some minor repairs then finally went kaput only need it for light cleaning this one started without problem and did the job it was intended for and it was reasonably priced
first off i could not get the package open then when i opened it there was no way to roll out the crescent shapes to form actual crescents i had to break off bits of dough roll them in my hands and make drop biscuits terrible
i have been using carmex for over years i keep a pot in my purse at work and almost every room of my house its wonderfully soothingrefreshing hydrating love it
for years i gave been sort of addicted to always have carmex with me wherever i go i cant sleep unless i have carmex on my lips i love carmex and i will always use it and nothing else because carmex is the best for my lips
i always purchase carmex original lip balm jar because it is convenient to carry and use the balm itself works wonders for your lips stars
its the only thing bf needs all winter construction long
this wine is amazing its not too sweet not to bitter it is a great inexpensive wine
carmex makes my chapped lips so soft that is all i buy
i have mycarmex with me wherever i go in the beach bag purse or pocket its always on hand to keep my lips moist and chap free
love carmex it works like a champ for relieving all problems
had a chance to try some this beverage wonderful sparkling taste great for celebrations
these were delicious i wish they came in a count tube they are becoming my firstchoice refrigerated biscuits
i got my carmex the first time i started having really chapped lips and it works wonder when taking this acne medication called roaccutane which causes lips to be dehydrated the orange flavor liquid lip conditioning tube has worked wonders for me these days i also used the original jar but right now i dont remember where i put it so i havent used it from what i remember it has a nice refreshing scent and also calms your lips from burning due to the extreme dryness
first lets establish that the whole point of buying tube crescent rolls is that they come off in little triangles that can be rolled into crescents hence crescent rolls these are no where in the vicinity of crescent rolls the dough stuck together would not unroll where i needed triangles i came out with sticky amorphous lumps of dough it was useless for the recipe i was making i was severely disappointed and will never again purchase these
im from pr and puertoricans love malta it is really good that walmart bring our products

i have used this product for years and years i love it in the original jar

these crescent rolls are just the same as the expensive ones
i recently have begun enjoying margaritas i havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet i like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor the reason i had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so i thought it would be a good start for me i didnt have to search long to find it and i actually paid a decent price for it the container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy i use jose cuervo to mix my margaritas although i think any tequila would work i dont shake mine yet because i still need to buy a shaker but i do give them a good mix the overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart but not overly powerful on those to senses i recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as i did so and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day i will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good
when your lips are cracked and chapped carmex gives immediate relief without the waxing feeling of most lip balms its medicated feeling is both soothing and healing with quick results
i bought this for an afternoon with friends and it was super refreshing really liked the quality of the mix
so i recently moved from pennsylvania to colorado huge elevation difference a few days ago a friend and i went to garden of the gods and i failed to bring chapstick the result was me linking my lips way too much and i suffered tremendously the next day my lips were on fire the day after that my lips were so severely chapeed i didnt even want to go to work well of course i went and i bought this little miracle in a jar within just a few hours my lips were better still chapped as they needed to heal but i was so shocked at how quickly carmex soothed my lips amazing i love it
highly highly recommend its sweet but not syrupy just right and i love that its bubbly i dont have to mix my wine with seltzer anymore
all the people i had referred this wine with were impressed as how smooth and tasty this wine is however this only has alcohol but thats about how far sweet reds go if you can find sweet red this sweet that is over alcohol content please let me know i absolutely love this sweet red

the current jar i am using i got from my mothers house after she passed my siblings were going to throw it away i told them to take their hands off of it because she ad just purchased it in december and this was march the best lip balm my mother bless her heart ever introduced me to you

we usually buy the tyson anytizer boneless wings but bought these to save a little money big mistake these wings have twice the sodium as the tyson chicken and you can definitely tell by the taste we ended up throwing the whole bag away next time well spend the extra dollar

the
let me first start by saying that i have suffered from severe chapped lips for as long as i can remember i literally layers of skin peeling off from my lips little by little suffice to say it can be quite painful while i visited my doctor i brought up my issue and he commanded carmex i was a bit skeptical but i went for it anyways i have tried so many remedies before to no availso why not another attemptwell let me tell you this is my very last attempt because carmex has improved my condition tremendously it is not only soothing and moisturizing but helped with the peeling and the chapped lips now my lips are baby soft supple and stays hydrated for long hours i could not ask for a better lip balm
love how carmex soothes and heals my chapped lips protects my lips when riding motorcycles great product and great packaging
this is the product i remember using the very most it seems as a child it was just always around us all the time for cracked winter skin then when the heat came out and cracked even more just great to have handy always

ive been using carmex original for years and i love it cant beat an original
carmex is my go to product most of the time when my lips are dry i love the original jar just because thats what i grew up with i think but i really love all carmex products i love the smell feel and how it helps my chapped lips
i love using carmen for everyday for a soft lipthis helps my lips from chapping
my sisters used to use this all the time they ran through jar upon jar of it as i was growing up considering i was a good years younger than them i just thought they were weird teenagers but when i turned  i was on the swim team at school and the other girls were using it for their chapped lips we had horribly dry lips due to the constant lap swimming we did in all weather times a week and after days we had amazing lips this stuff is the real deal the girls who didnt use carmex were looking a little raw faced at our trials we used it even on our cheeks to help with windburn and it was phenomenal for elbows too it really does work for everything and now i know why we had so many empty tiny yellow jars everywhere
they are as good as the name brand product taste the same but cost a lot less
a friend told me about this product and i tried it and i loved it i wish that i had knew about it sooner
if i dont have carmex in my bag i dont leave home pot stick tube i think am addicted  truth is am prone to cold sores and need to use it often to safeguard my lips wish you had special deals for clients who cant live without it
dark ales specially british and clamato picante or original
i have teenage boys with very dry lips that tend to crack they thought it was girlie to use the tube or the stick i gave them the jar and they love it no more cracked lips and their manhood is in tact
i have been using carmex since the mid s when it was still in the little glass pots i keep the empties and refill them theres something about the weight and feel i have used a lot of different lip balms and carmex is the best by far
great item and ready for pickup in timely manner however i wish i could have ordered more than at a time i needed and ended up placing orders
this is so delicious you can actually make a perfect tasting smooth manhattan like a pro great product
great item just like the brand name stuff sad thing is sometimes you can get the brand name even cheaper than the walmart brand
this has been used in my house for over years
you dont know how lucky you are to have carmex lip balm in a jar i came to texas from miles away to find lips here are spoiled every day they are being moistened with a balm that makes my red and inflamed lips super calm plesant aroma that is second to none and pretty soon you will have yours all gone not to fear tho carmex lip balm in a jar cuz everyone here knows who you are just ask and you will see who has that balm takes only seconds and its in your lucky little palm i love carmex lip balm never fails to heal my lips and keep them soft and moist

my boyfriend and i buy this all the time our lips get so chapped in the winter and carmex is the only thing that works and helps heal our chapped lips
i ordered of these buckets and when i opened them up a couple of the buckets had holes in the bottom the margarita was good
i remember when i first was introduced to carmex my mother put it on our chapped lips in the winter i remember the tingling feeling on my lips and i loved it i still use it today and when friends ask me what do i use instead of the usual chapstick or whatever else most people use i always say carmex because it works well its actually the only lipcare that i usealso perfect as a base before i put on lipstick it just absolutely works thats it a lot of other brands work for an hour or few but with carmex your lips stay moisturized well and helps to prevent cold sores although i dont get them its nice to know that it also will care for them not only fo rthe cooler months but all seasons especially when winter comes carmex it is
these great value buffalo style boneless wyngz are extremely hot if you like spicy hot flavors in your food then these are for you i thought they cooked up well but i just did not care for the spicy hotness of them
i buy it all the time for dry lips it works wonders for the dry summer and winter months
i am a lifelong carmex user not only does it keep my lips from drying and cracking during the searing summer months and frigid winter months but when i used to play in the marching band it was an indispensable tool i would never go without playing a wind instrument in extreme weather conditions can be murder on your lips but carmexs invigorating healing power kept my lips fresh safe and protected  even under the most punishing conditions it doesnt wear off easily like some other brands and you can actually feel it healing your lips immediatelythis stuff works miracles
its really good for kids and they will love it has a variety which is great

lime juice tapatio sauceclamato juice and bud light

i have to be honest for boneless chicken wyngz these are definitely my favorite i prefer them over the tyson brand the only complaint i have is they are very hard to get in my local store they are regularly out of them that can be frustrating
sweet low alcohol content enjoy sipping
i couldnt be without this product i use it every single day to keep chapped lips at bay and if i do happen to get chapped lips upping mu carmex usage does the trick
delish
ive used this for past years bought it one winter and realized not only did it heal my chapped lips but i use it nightly and feel its keeps my lips from getting dry or cracked overnight love the smell too
my lips wouldnt be able to survive a winter without this
love iti do however wish they had it in individual servings
i had dry lips and my lips were pealing and my husband knew i needed this because i had an engagement to go to and i wouldnt go looking like this so he bought it for me and said use it and it worked in a few hours and my lips looked a lot better
i started using carmex when i moved back home to chicago in  a coworker at the hospital turned me onto carmex she told me it was a staple for winters in chicago i have used it ever since and i live in the southeast now its not just good for sore chapped winter lips its perfect for surfing a lipstick base or gloss or just dry lips believe me just ask my hubby i have jars in all my cars and my purses and stashed everywhere so its always handy ive traveled the world with my original carmex in the jar carmex has been with me to mexico jamaica the bahamas and all over the usa i turn everyone on to carmex that i spark conversation with while traveling 
i discovered carmex original lip balm more than ten years ago since then ive never used a different brand the soothing difference is like night day i am constantly recommending carmex lip balm to all my friends even acquaintances that display an immediate need to get some relief from chapped lips cold sores as i know beyond a reasonable doubt that i end up a hero without exception they love it too cant believe theyve just discovered it i always have an unopenedunused tube with me that i then give to the newest convert the love is overwhelming thanks carmex
i bought this jar a couple of months ago i use this lip balm every day it glides on smooth and makes my lips feel great i love this carmex
my mother used this on me when i was little and i continue to use it today i thought i was strange because all my friends always had chapstick but not me i had my carmex and the most awesome thing in the world is that both me and my boyfriend use it i guess we are just that awesome
i purchase these and separate and freeze them i have boys so they are always handy
i have been using carmex for decades and will not use anything else we lived in maryland in the late s and i could not find it there when i came home to kansas i bought enough to last and some for other people from kansas that were there too i highly recommend it to anyone
i bought this a week ago i love it i has helped my lips so much
spicy terrific bloody mary mix
i like them a little undercooked so i pull them out a minute early i like the taste much better than pillsbury crecents easy and fast to make they make a great snack or roll for dinner
tart not sweetvery refreshing and delicious
i was told at a wine store that this wine is more of a mix of two different red wines other then the fact that it leaves a bit of red on my lips even after ive finished drinking i loved it if you enjoy bitter red wines this is pretty good ive tried many cheaper bitter red wines and the price point and quality of this so far has been great id definitely suggest giving this a try you just might like it
works pretty well the only downside to it is it makes you extremely gassy which can be embarrassing at times
i bought this like a month ago and recommendations wasnt as well
i grew up with this stuff my mom always had a jar on her ill buy this product forever
i have been buying these little pots for years not only to heal my lips but to protect themthis product keeps my lips soft and full and free from painful cracks during the winteras a pharmacist i also recommend this product
ive used the lip balm jar for quite a few years now needless to say that i have no complaints about it live in tx where it is hot as heck and my lips dont dry out just make sure you put it on before going outside never put it on as your walking youll get sunburned lips no joke
living in michigan you tend to have to endure some frigid winters with the cold temperatures you also deal with cold winds that dry your skin and chap your lips using carmex you not only heal your chapped lips you also create a great barrier that helps prevent them from capping again
my son and i have them in every room in the house and the car we would never go anywhere without them my husband think we are a little bit strange but thats ok by us
i use this product religiously if i forget it at home when i go to work i get another jar on my way to work i cant go without it my lips are always dry and chapped as i am a lip chewer and carmex always helps my lips heal and stop hurting
i love the cobblestone original english muffins being from new england these are the type of english muffins i am used to i dont like those other ones with the nooks and crannies in new england you can find this type in every grocery store not necessarily the cobblestone brand its hard to find this type in the south seems like they only sell thomass which are gross sometimes i can find these at food lion but my walmart doesnt even have a spot on the shelf
i buy carmex lip balm for me all the time it leaves my lips soft and smooth never lets me down i take it everywhere especially to the beach
i have been using carmex in the little jar ever since it came in a real glass jar it is my go to dry cracked lip fix now days when i buy a new jar i transfer the product to my old trusty glass jar
so i bought my first carmex three years ago i think because i saw a friend had it i just love it i use it when i wake up during the day when needed and before i go to bed my lips havent been dry in three years how amazing isnt that i have used one of this jar and i am halfway through the second one so one and a half jar in three years  amazing i also got the cherry one recently and i love the scent of it ah this product is just perfect and i really recommend it to everyone
we always purchase carmex lip balm in the jar it is usually hard to find so when we do find it we empty the shelf to have it on hand winters can be harsh in pennsylvania so we do not want to run out it keeps you lips soft year round
really nice
as soon as a cold snap occurs it time to buy jars of carmex leave it in bathroom kitchen and bedroom this way you have access to it all the time the climate gets very dry  and zaps your lips for me carmex is never out of reach  the best product to keep your lips from chapping especially when shoveling in cold winter months
i have used carmex almost all of my life and have always loved this product the most it is the best at moisturizing and healing chapped andor cracked lips it actually does what it says it will
i love this stuff i was addicted to bliss stick but for the last years i ran across this at the store it was so smooth and not greasy on my lips and i have bought it faithfully every year i dont really care for the cherry but i will use it even my grandkids call it by name they have to have their own personal one also we love it
excellent flavor  i drink it by itself but mostly i use this to make my bloody marys 
this is an amazing mixjust add rum i usually add a little pineapple juice and a cherry mix it with crushed ice enjoy
i have a problem with cold sores  usually keep abreva on hand but i have found that carmex really helps with the discomfort of having a cold sore so in addition to using it as a moisturizer i now use it every time i have a cold sore outbreak
this little tin of carmex is amazing seems to last forever and is small enough to take anywhere and everywhere without getting damaged this product seems to be a miracle worker i go from dry chapped lips to smoothhh moisturised lips in the space of minutes can not get enough of carmex
it helps digestion
i have been using carmex on my lips for as long as i can remember this little yellow tub is full of moisture for my lips it is convenient to carry easy to stick your finger in and grab a dab to apply i would recommend this to anyone
i buy them all the time  for my purse  car  backpack  pocket  car and the list goes on  i make sure that i have carmax handy  so that my lips stay moist and shiny
you cant go wrong with a classic  been using this stuff for over years goes on smooth
ok for replacement but still not as good on brand name product
this is a good product and it works as expected i am not sure why so many reviews are there criticizing it you are buying a dough and you got to mold it as you need not sure being flaky and all is a valid critic for this product it holds shape as it should and bakes nicelyit tastes good and nice this worked just as planned and i was able to make rolls as planned will recommend  thank you walmart

i have always gotten horrific fever blisters and tried everything to soothe them  if youre not aware they are very painful  anyways a friend of mine asked me if i had ever tried carmex and i hadnt and had honestly given up hope that anything would ever work so i was out at my local drug store and seen the carmex and picked up a jar as a last ditch effort  boy was i so glad that i did carmex has been a life saver for me i know that sounds shallow but its the truth i felt immediate results and my fever blisters healed quickly and the carmex soothed them needless to say i have jars and tubes of carmex every where in my house car purses etc you can never have enough i use it multiple times a day and my lips are so smooth and protected thank you for such a wonderful product carmex
i use this product particularily in the cold winter months and it does a great job of protecting my lips from the weather i put this thick gel a little goes a long way under lipcolor during the day generously on my lips as a conditioning treatment during the night and on the skin near my nose when im sick that gets dried and irritated from blowing my nose this product works and is a budgetfriendly staple for anyones makeup collection my only complaint is im not a fan of the smell in the future would love a less stinkymedicated scent

purchased these with a sell by date of january  opened them november  and they were shrunk to  can capacity and smelled bad the container was undamaged prior to opening
when i bought the new carmex thats in a pkg rather than how they used to sell it in an open boxi noticed that it went up in price not a big deal since that happens with time everything seems to go up but what i was upset about was that even though it looks like the same jar if you look underneath the indentation goes up so far that it is about half of what you used to get i have an old glass jar and compared to the new plastic one the indentation on the bottom is at least half way up now ive noticed the ones that are not in pkgs have a tight plastic sticker on the bottom to cover up that fact i havent bought any carmex since i was going to email the company but they sent me an email to review their product
not as good as pilsbury the cressants did not come off easily they stuck together
i absolutely love carmex it works so fast on sore cracked lips in the winter or when im sick

i bought this when i was a little kid and everytime i use it it takes me back to the old days and it is the same as always which is perfect
