after tasting the smooth flavor of this mix i discovered a more natural way to enjoy a manhattan
back when i was little and complained about my super dry and chapped lips i remember my dad handing me a little jar of lip stuff now i have all forms of carmex but this one holds memories as i apply it to fix my aweful lips
i bought this for the first time about months ago and i love it i now only buy carmex
i love this so much that i buy them at a time been using this for years and will keep using it forever
tasty little treats gives fiber and fills the sweet tooth no gassy side effects
without a doubt the only way to make an authentic michelada
i like these better than thomas english muffins the texture and preslitting is better
this is my favorite carmex product i keep one in my purse and another in my dresser it works wonderfully for dry chapped lips to freshen up lipstick or if i have a small cold sore
i like the way carmex is silky smooth i has a sort of menthol fragrance to it it does heal and protect it is my st choice for a chap stick
buy walmart brand products all the time compares to brand name products
actually the great value crescent rolls in my areas walmarts come in a white package with black and blue writing  plus a picture of a couple beautiful crescent rolls nonetheless i expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable i bought dozen of the various types  flaky butter reduced fat and standard  and all had the same problems to some degree although i was using the rolls up to weeks prior to the jun expiration date on the endcap of the packages the dough in many packages was so dry old poorly stored that it would stick to the packaging and it was impossible to unroll the dough i had to pry off chunks  and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some frankenrolls the other reviews say the same thing  going back as far as  and now im extending that same complaint to mid why has walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for at least years my recommendation spend the extra cents or whatever on the real thing pillsbury crescent rolls
i use carmen daily i work in fresh seafood going from freezers to refrigeration does damage on lips apply my carmex problem solved
i love that my lips are protected during the winter and they dont crack or get chapped if only there was a product to keep the rest of my face protected
one great product hard to find in the ounce bottles makes a great old fashion note use with splendamakes a very low calorie drink
when my lips need soothing carmex does the trick
i really like this product but dont like the messiness of using fingers to get it out prefer the stick version
weve been drinking this wine for a while its one of a group we buy regularly because its a good wine at an affordable price
been using this stuff since i was a teenager its the only thing that kicks my cold sores butt in a timely manner plus if gives so much relief period
good for mixing cocktails a little more sour than other brands but not bad
wow i have been using this product for as long as i remember and it has been such a blessing to my chapped lips it makes them feel like they arent real they are just so smooth
this is great for the kids variety and the price is right
good coffee medium roast  with natural ingredients ingredients watercoffee extractsugarmilk powdersoy lecithin emulsifier
zing zang is a great drink that i supplement my diet with when im craving spicy food it has the perfect combination of tomato juice spices that make each drink delicious
refreshing simple delicious cant wait to use this mix for all my summer get togethers
i wear it no matter the season its great specially when im sick and have to breather through my mouth it will stay on all night
if the mouth of the bottle was bigger it would make it easier to get the product out after putting in the freezer im sure other people do this making large batches once the tequila is mixed in the mix melts quickly so placing in the freezer would speed up the process if you could then get it out why only stars
not only is this item great for bloody marys but its super for chili
this is a great supplement to non alcoholic drinks ie green tea my store quit having it available however i found it online here great for entertaining and adding to punch a little goes a long way
my entire family uses carmex because it is the only effective lip balm on this earth we stock up on it whenever it goes on sale so we will be prepared just keep on producing it please
i purchased this delightful little jar approximately two weeks ago in preparation for the impending winter months and the inevitably chapped and cracked lips in the vast world we all live in today we are often overwhelmed by the huge number of choices we are faced with every day even when it comes to something as simple as which chap stick we want to purchase i cant thank carmex enough for forever making this little choice easier for me by creating a lip balm that is by and far above the rest their simple yet elegant design combined with their no nonsense get the job done formula make this the obvious choice for anyone looking to have healthy happy lips throughout the holiday season
love this mix
this product did not have any flavor it was very bland to call itself spicy
great fruity dry rose
i have really sensituve lips and thus product is fantastic for them no reaction at all and it lasts a long time before needing to reapply
it was a little tart but i like that
if you love frozen drinks this is easy preparation and great tasting not just for parties

i love this stuff i like coco lopez but it is in a can which makes it difficult to use just a couple of tablespoons i add it to my fruit smoothies and gives them just that touch of sweetness and coconut flavoring to make them pop right now i am using it with an orange chicken stir fry my problem is that i have been looking for it for about a month and cannot find it at the walmart stores where i bought it originally while this is a great product i really dont want to buy a case of it however if that is the only way i can get it i may have no other choice please start stocking this in the stores

i have been buying the carmex jar as long as i can remember the reason i have bought it for so many years is i was in the military and would throw it in my bag work bag i never had the jar crushed or come open even when the bag was tossed around and all my gear would hit it
we have fallen in love with this bread it reminds us of the great sourdough breads we used to buy in san fransisco it has the most incredible rich delicious sourdough flavor as well as the perfect texture we stock up on it every time we can find it on the shelf at walmart but its not always there please make this a regular item that is always in stock there is no other bread that comes close to the quality of this one

i usually make my own cosmos but thought is would be quicker to use a mix bad idea this particular flavor was soooo sweet i had to keep adding lime to it to temper the sickysweetness if you like sweet then this is for you does not taste like a true cosmo with their recipe
no bitter after taste just spicy enough price was a good price
ive tried countless lip care products from countless brands across different price points and nothing beats the carmex original jar it instantly soothes dry lips and regular application helps keep your lips looking and feeling great this formulation is great to use yearround as its emollient both in colder and hotter weather do yourself a favor and apply as liberally and as often as possible you wont regret it

i am a whiskey sour lover but imbibing only when out to dinner hubby suggested trying home i was so happy to find this product my walmart supercenter first its taste is great not much difference in taste from mr and mrs ts which is slightly higher in price prior to purchasing walmart wasnt aware they carried mixers  foolish on my part  duh they have everything i was paying like  to  per bottle other stores at walmart believe it or not it is so i stocked up bought bottles they also have it in a lite versionsugarfree and i thought that would be greatnot so i drink sugerfree pop but this doesnt taste as good in the sugarfree version so tomorrow i am going to exchange of the bottles for the regular type hey a few carbs here and thereoh well love walmart i especially love that you have the ability to check the availability of the product online before treking out especially since the mixer is pretty much only sold the supercenters and we have within a mile radiusbut only one has it

i have been using carmex since the s when my mother introduced me to it i in turn introduced it to my husband he cannot do without it due to his addiction we probably keep  jars stashed around the house and in the cars one on each side of the bed one in the bathroom one in each of our cars there is always at least in the laundry room freshly laundered  in his desk drawer and a couple of brand new ones just in case my only disappointment was the day i went to buy an new jar and the package felt different my beloved jar was now plastic my little wonderfully feeling porcelain i believe jar was gone i have to admit that month i searched for my beloved jar in every store i went in the hopes that they had not sold out of them only to be replaced by the new plastic jar i dont know about anyone else but i would gladly pay an uncharge to have my beloved and true classic original jar back once again

refreshing taste of beer especially for summer citrus combined w blueberry
i didnt find this to be sweet at all but everyones taste differs i usually dont like sweet wines so i gravitate towards chardonnay and some sauvignon blancs and i felt like this one had more of a buttery taste than a sweet citrusy taste like another reviewer stated for the price this is definitely a keeper

im going to do a review on the st product made by carmex because this one is the first one i have ever tried its what got me hooked on this lip balm where it all started i tried this product when i was years old my lips were so chapped that it was so painful and red as soon as my aunt and uncle purchased it for me it stopped my pain right away and within a couple of days it was gone i have never had a problem with this product and as of today i still carry carmex in my purse a for this product made by carmex and its affordable thank you for making my life easier your fan lia anderson from flint mi
i love the way carmex smells it not only works better then anything else i have tried but it smells wonderful the only thing that i found that works as well is antibiotic ointment but it does not have that great smell so give me carmex
it was in annasiriya iraq that i was introduced to carmex and have been a true believer ever since we were pulling security at the ziggurat of ur while the iraqis had their very first meeting at an attempt at self governance we were in the hot sun all day and at the end of the day i had a blister on my lip that looked like a cigarette had been put out on my lip a fellow soldier suggested carmex i was given some and it worked like a charm healing this burn and preventing any more burns since that time may  i returned to southern iraq in and spent january to february in kandahar province afghanistan and every time i took a good supply of carmex that saved my lips from burning from the extreme sun found in the areai told everyone that if they wanted to send me a care package to please send some carmex
i love this mix its easy and taste delicious
i only stumbled upon this after reading its apparently created by walmart its a private label brand from what i read not sure how true that is but the taste was good all throughout but i still have or left in the case to try at a little less than a dollar per can the price cant be beat if you want to try something different lol

best margarita for summer with friends
i have used this for years and its very soothing love it
i simply love clamato  its simply delicious however the sodium content is so high that i do not drink it at all anymore if a low sodium version was made it would be the only product of this nature i would purchase
this moscow mule mix is so delicious and refreshing i will definitely be telling friends about this so easy to make great for a party
i prefer to purchase this in the store individually but will do whatevers necessary to get it absolutely a magnificent mixer
love the flavor and the spice great bloody marys or red beer
i have been using carmex for chapped lips since my lips were always chapped when i was a kid my dad gave it to me and said this works great and dads know everything that was years ago and i still use it today
i used this for a crust and it was wonderful
i like this way better than tomato juice
this source of chewable fiber is my favorite it tastes fruity and it is convenient  those two reasons alone keep me from not making the effort i simply cant stand the orange drink fiber option  it has a gross texture and makes me feel bloated after drinking it these are kind of a treat some reviewers dont care for these but dont strike me as chalky or sticktoteeth or anything this review was collected as part of a promotion
use this all the time keeps my lips moist no matter what the weather
not too sweet or tart makes the best margarita weve had
i have used this product everyday for years i love it so much i keep a container in several rooms throughout the house it keeps your lips feeling moisturizer and healthy
best chapstick that i have found i have tried many
did not buy for any special occasion but great to have around to mix up when friends come by this review was collected as part of a promotion
product works extremely well and heals chapped lips quickly
i have been using this product for years i apply nightly and never have a problem with dry or chapped lips it is the only product i will use
bought this recently and did the temporary job although i feel like its a bit messy having to wipe the finger off afterward and only a temp lip fix
good as name brand
i love this stuff i add vodka and freeze then scoop out and its a great slushi
i really enjoyed its taste and price best mixer i have ever tasted
good
omglove love the best cocktail mix ever a must try for everyone dont miss out
i love the carmex products and the best tried and true in the little round container it is the best to protect lips in the weather and being outside a lot it is so great
make sure you use crushed ice little to sweet on the rocks
always have in my bag never leave home without it keeps my lips soft and non chapped
im usually skeptical of a mix but this is the real deal
i have a tub of carmex in my purse and in every room of my house i use this product throughout the day
there is nothing better on the market than carmex it is the only thing that works on severely chapped lips its the best 
keeps lips moist for a long while but could be better
clamato does not have a distinct clam flavor its refreshing and with a nice balance to the tomato and clam and lime and spices its a nice alternative to v or tomato juice and works well in a cocktail blend
i bought this on a whim around days ago and im so glad i did the results were instant and my dry chapped lips were gone straight away and it lasts for hours definitely purchasing again
cobblestone english muffins wheat ct are they spose to be so doughy hard to slice cuz the doughy inside ballsup taste very good only after toasting till the edges burn
i use this in the winter time and i get almost instant results from chapping and dry to smooth in no time at all
carmex in the original jar is my goto for everything from wind chapped lips to winter cracking and anytime my lips just feel a little dry it works the best every time and although ive tried just about everything else on the planet nothing beats carmex carmex beats everything for anything
not personally into pre made mixes but bought this for entertaining friends the other night was extremely impressed so smooth and balanced everyone loved their manhattans all you have to do is add your whiskey or bourbon of choice there are no artificial flavors or high fructose corn syrups in the mix either just pure cane sugar honestly probably safer than using the liqueurs on the market as a bartender myself im telling you to get this product
i buy this all the time and i have at least open at one time in my purse by my computer desk right on my night stand and of course one riding my car i have dry lips all the time and carmex is my best friend it keeps my lips soft and moist and kissable for my husband
i love this carmex lip balm my lips were in such a need of this awesome product i had chapped lips and now i am in heaven its really last and this is one item i cant leave my house with
ive been buying carmex for a while now and i love it i love how soft my lips feel after wearing it
heavy glass easy to find and feels great on the lips
use this often after i put on my lipstick and this keeps my lips moist and works as a lip gloss
i am a huge fan of the moscow mule drink after oprah turned me on to it but i never make it myself this mix made making moscow mules so easy that i invested in a set of cooper mugs delicious simple and refreshing going to stock up for summer
this product is great cooks just as well if not better than name brands the only kind i purchase now
schweppes makes a good diet tonic i prefer canada dry only because it seems to hold the fizz longer i dont drink generic i have not found any of the offbrands that taste good compared to schweppes and canada dry please dont stop carrying or even add canada dry the only other thing i suggest is to stock more on the shelves as most of the time there is maybe one or two on the shelf sartell walmart
for those of you who want to enjoy a nice beverage that is not as sweet try this mix my husband has been purchasing this for some time now added to that we pay the yearly one time purchase to have future items from walmart shipped to your home free so worth the cost
ive used alot of carmex and other brands but this one by far is the bestit was my favorite when i was a kid and its my favorite now that im 
i have been using carmex for years and it never fails me

gluten free plus lower on calories plus very refreshing

this is a rich and delicious red wineblend that many will enjoy its full of dark fruit flavors and zinfindel the best red blend that i have ever had
ive tried a number of different mai tai mixes and this is the best one by far but it can be hard to find in stores im glad i found it online so that i no longer have to worry about finding someplace that carries it for my perfect mai tai i use a combination of trader vics dark and spiced rums this mai tai mix and a splash of orange juice
would buy this again and recommend this to friends
i had tried a new lip butter but went back to carmex original lip balm jar because it lasts longer and is less expensive i used to apply lip balm sticks during the day and carmex jar at night but the lip balm sticks dont last so now i use the jar all day too i even bought a package of jars because it saves me money

my mother always carried this in her purse i have been using carmex since i can remember a sence of home and family is created when i see smell use carmex original lip balm jar great product
the last time i bought buffalo wings i bought a name brand i was very disappointed with them as they had almost no heat at all i bought the great value brand last time and i was apprehensive but i could not believe how much flavor they had and how spicy they were they were delicious
love the taste very good
ive been using this product and the tube for years and love the compliments i get in my lips

carmex protects my lips keeps them smooth heals  spring summer fall and winter  protects my lips from wind burn in the summer  heals capped lips in the winter  i always keep carmex on hand
its great i love using it but i suggest you guys make a bigger jar or a family sized jar so it can last longer
i love the flavor
im hooked on the mango flavor of master of mixes i love to put the mix in a blender and mix it with ice for a cold smoothie summer drink i love the strawberry flavor too anyone who like icys would love the mango flavor of master of mixes as well as the other flavors also
great value on this size bottle
